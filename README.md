#BayCrosser

##About

In order to demo the [actransit_rails gem](https://github.com/sanjayypatel/actransit_rails), I wrote a small transit web app, [BayCrosser](http://baycrosser.herokuapp.com), that pulls updated Transbay bus schedules. (Transbay buses cross the Bay Bridge, allowing commuters from the East Bay to get into Downtown SF).

The app is designed to fit one simple role: telling you available trips for a selected Transbay bus route. I kept the app simple to focus on using the gem, and on making an app that worked quickly on mobile devices.

You can read more about my work on BayCrosser and the ACTransit_Rails gem at [sanjayypatel.com](http://sanjayypatel.com/portfolio/actransitrails/).

##Feedback/Contribute

Even though it started as just a demo app, I'd like to keep working on BayCrosser. Any user feedback or development contributions are welcome.  Just submit a pull request or issue.
